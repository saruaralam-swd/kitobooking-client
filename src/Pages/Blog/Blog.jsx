              There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in
              your React apps:
            </p>
            <li>Local state</li>
            <li>Global state</li>
            <li>Server state</li>

              How does prototypical inheritance work?

              The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
              methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an
              object can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
              Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an
              object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object
            </p>
            <p>
              Each object has a private property which holds a link to another
              object called its prototype.

              What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?

            <p>
              <span className="text-semibold">Unit Testing</span> is a type of
              software testing where individual units or components of a
              software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of
              the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done
              during the development (coding phase) of an application by the
              developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its
              correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method,
              procedure, module, or object.
            </p>
            <p>
              A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of
              code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most
              programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method
              or property. The isolated part of the definition is important.

              React vs. Angular vs. Vue?
            </h2>

                  React can be used as a UI library to render elements, without
                  enforcing a specific project structure, and that’s why it’s
                  not strictly a framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                  React Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.
                  They are more powerful than DOM elements because the React DOM
                  makes sure to update them efficiently whenever something
                  changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Components are larger building blocks that define independent
                  and reusable pieces to be used throughout the application.
                  They accept inputs called props and produce elements that are
                  then displayed to the user.

                <p>
                  In this article, I’m discussing Angular 2, and not the first
                  version of the framework which is now known as AngularJS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  AngularJS, the original framework, is an MVC
                  (Model-View-Controller) framework. But in Angular 2, there’s
                  no strict association with MV*-patterns as it is also
                  component-based.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Projects in Angular are structured into Modules, Components,
                  and Services. Each Angular application has at least one root
                  component and one root module.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="space-y-2">
                <li className="text-2xl">Vue</li>
                <p>
                  The Vue.js core library focuses on the View layer only. It’s
                  called a progressive framework because you can extend its
                  functionality with official and third-party packages, such as
                  Vue Router or Vuex, to turn it into an actual framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Vue is not strictly associated with the MVVM
                  (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, its design was partly inspired
                  by it. With Vue, you’ll be working mostly on the ViewModel
                  layer, to make sure that the application data is processed in
                  a way that allows the framework to render an up-to-date View.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Vue’s templating syntax lets you create View components, and
                  it combines familiar HTML with special directives and
                  features. This templating syntax is preferred, even though raw
                  JavaScript and JSX are also supported.
